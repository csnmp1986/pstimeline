<h1>NHS Patient Safety Timeline</h1>

<div class="content">

    <p>This is a timeline of historical developments relating to the management of patient harm and safety in the NHS. It has been designed to be of use to academics, researchers, policymakers, campaigners, and others with a broad interest in patient safety.</p>
    <p>The timeline is shared under a Creative Commons license, meaning that the timeline is free to be used or adapted in research and teaching elsewhere, with attribution to Dr Christopher Sirrs/the Hazardous Hospitals project.</p>
    <p><em></em></p><p><em><strong>When did patient safety in the NHS begin?</strong></em></p><p><em></em></p><p><em></em>Patient safety became a major object of healthcare policy in Britain with the publication of the report <em>An Organisation with a Memory </em>by the Department of Health in 2000. However, patient safety has a very long prehistory, and various elements of patient safety, such as the need to report incidents in hospitals, or learn from patient deaths, have long been recognised. The following timeline explores key developments in patient safety since 2000, as well as events and developments which contributed to evolving understanding of patient harm in the NHS since 1948.</p>

<p>NPSA publishes first iteration of its <em>Never Events Policy Framework</em>. 'Never events' are defined as 'serious, largely preventable patient safety incidents that should not occur if the available preventative measures have been implemented.' Initially, eight never events are listed including wrong-site surgery and retained instrument post-operation. The term 'Never Event' was first introduced in 2001 by Ken Kizer, the former CEO of the National Quality Forum in the USA.</p>

The report draws attention to improvement in various indicators of patient safety at a national level in England, but also ongoing areas of concern, notably around maternity services, staff shortages, access to care, and waiting lists. The report recommends that the breadth of patient safety data needs to increase; that the accuracy of key patient safety measures needs to improve; the need for an urgent workforce plan for the NHS and social care; that Integrated Care Systems should play a central role in monitoring patient safety; and that progress in the safety of maternity services needs to accelerate.</p>
